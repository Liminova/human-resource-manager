## Usage

This repository uses `pipenv` to manage its dependencies and Python interpreter.
If you don't already have `pipenv` installed:

```shell
$ pip install --user pipenv
```

Afterwards, you can automatically setup the virtual environment by running:

```shell
$ pipenv install
```

Everything else can be ran under the environment managed by `pipenv` by:

```shell
$ pipenv run <command>
```
